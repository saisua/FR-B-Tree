# FR-B-Tree
Fuzzy Multi-Regex B-Tree data structure for compilating regex matchers

This project goes along, and has its main use as a sub-project of another project of mine <a href="https://github.com/saisua/Language">Language</a>, in which I try to generate a Programming language compiler, using regex to detect and categorize lines of code to be compiled.

I think this could speed up the matching process, and help stablish a fuzzy search on programming languages, which could help detect issues like issing colons, parenthesis, or misspelled calls.
